In this blog post, I will walk you through a project where I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using the GitHub Actions for a Java-based web application. The application is deployed on AWS EKS cluster. The EKS infrastructure was created using Terraform, but in this blog, we\`ll mainly focus on the CI/CD part handled by GitHub Actions.

### Tools Used are

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD automation for the entire pipeline |
| Maven | Build tool to compile and package Java code |
| SonarQube | Static code analysis and quality gate checks |
| Trivy | Security scanning for vulnerabilities |
| Gitleaks | Detects secrets like tokens or passwords in code |
| Docker | Containerizes the application |
| AWS EKS | Hosts the application in a Kubernetes cluster |
| Terraform | Provisioned EKS infrastructure (not covered here) |

### What Does This CI/CD Pipeline Do?

The GitHub Actions Pipeline does the following tasks:

1. Compiles the Java application using Maven
    
2. Performs security checks using Trivy and Gitleaks
    
3. SonarQube to analyze code quality
    
4. Packages the application and uploads the artifact
    
5. Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub
    
6. Deploys the application to an AWS EKS cluster using kubectl
    

Let\`s break it down step by step

### Step 1: Code Compilation

```yaml
jobs:
  compile:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: setup JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: 'maven'
    - name: compile code
      run: mvn compile
```

This Job compiles the code.

**Checkout the code**

* Uses the ***actions/checkout*** action to clone the repository into the GitHub actions runner.
    
* This helps all the other steps to use the project files.
    

Set up Java and Maven

* Installing the Java 17 using the ***actions/setup-java***
    
* Also set up Maven with caching
    

**Compile the code**

* Run the ***mvn compile*** command to compile the source code and check for any syntax and build-time errors
    

### Step 2: Security Scans with Trivy & Gitleaks

```yaml
security_checks:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: compile
        steps:
        - name: checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: trivy scan
          run: trivy fs --format table -o output.json .
        - name: gitleaks scan
          run: gitleaks detect source . -r gitleaks-output.json -f json
```

This Job scans the file system and gives the information about known vulnerabilities and the secrets if any present in the project.

**Checkout Code**

* As we know each job runs on the different GitHub Actions runner, so for each job we need to clone the code into the runner.
    
* As this will help for the other steps in the job
    

**Trivy Scan**

* Runs ***trivy fs*** command to find the any known vulnerabilities in the project.
    

**Gitleaks Scan**

* Gitleaks checks for any accidentally committed secrets (like API keys or passwords).
    

> Security checks help prevent exposing vulnerable code or leaking sensitive information.

### Step 3: SonarQube Code Quality Analysis

```yaml
 sonar_scan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: setup JDK 17
          uses: actions/setup-java@v4
          with:
            java-version: '17'
            distribution: 'temurin'
            cache: 'maven'
        - name: sonar scan
          uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v5.1.0
          env:
            SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
            SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ vars.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
        - name: SonarQube Quality Gate check
          id: sonarqube-quality-gate-check
          uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-quality-gate-action@master
          with:
            pollingTimeoutSec: 600
          env:
            SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
            SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ vars.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```

This job scans the code and gives the report about the code quality.

**Checkout Code**

* As we know each job runs on the different GitHub Actions runner, so for each job we need to clone the code into the runner.
    

**Set up Java and Maven**

* Installing the Java 17 using the ***actions/setup-java***
    
* This is used by the SonarQube for checking the code quality.
    

**SonarQube Scan**

* It performs a static code analysis of your project to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, security issues, and code coverage.
    
* Generates a detailed report with metrics (e.g., technical debt, duplication, complexity).
    

**SonarQube Quality Gate Check**

* Defines a set of **pass/fail criteria** that a project must meet to be considered "production-ready."
    
* Determines if the code meets the required quality standards.
    
* Fails the build(in CI/CD) if conditions are not met.
    

> **Note:** Store your **SONAR\_TOKEN** (secret) and **SONAR\_HOST\_URL** (variable) securely in your GitHub repository settings under **Secrets and Variables**.

### Step 4: Build and Upload Artifact

```yaml
 build_artifact:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: setup JDK 17
          uses: actions/setup-java@v4
          with:
            java-version: '17'
            distribution: 'temurin'
            cache: 'maven'
        - name: building artifact
          run: mvn package
        - name: upload artifact
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
          with:
            name: web-app
            path: ./target/*.war
```

This job is for building the artifact, and uploading artifact so that in other jobs if the artifact is needed we can download it and use it.

**Checkout Code**

* For cloning the code into the GitHub Action runner machine.
    

**Set up Java and Maven**

* Installing Java and Maven using the action ***actions/setup-java.***
    

**Building the Artifact**

* Runs *mvn package* command for packing the application into a .war file.
    

**Uploading Artifact**

* .war file is uploaded as an artifact to be used in later stages (jobs).
    
* uses the *actions/upload-artifact* action for uploading the artifact.
    

> Artifacts are important for reusing the built application in later steps like image creation.

### Step 5: Build and Push Docker Image

```yaml
 build_and_push_image:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
            IMAGE_NAME: java_maven
            DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.run_number }}
        steps:
        - name: checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: download artifact
          uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
          with:
            name: web-app
            path: target/
        - name: docker login
          uses: docker/login-action@v3
          with: 
            username: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
        - name: Build and push
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
          with:
            context: .
            push: true
            tags: ${{ env.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
```

This job is for building and pushing docker image

**Checkout code**

* For cloning the code into the runner.
    

**Downloading Artifact**

* Artifact that is uploaded in the previous job is downloaded in this job, because artifact is needed for building the docker image.
    
* Uses ***actions/download-artifact*** action for downloading the artifact.
    

**Docker Login**

* Using the action ***docker/login-action*** for login into Docker Hub or other image registry.
    

**Build and Push image**

* This step is for building and pushing the docker image into the docker hub registry.
    
* Uses *docker/build-push-action* for build and push image.
    

> **Note:** Store your **DOCKER\_USERNAME** (variable) and **DOCKER\_PASSWORD** (secret) securely in your GitHub repository settings under **Secrets and Variables**.

### Step 6: Deploy to AWS EKS

```yaml
deploy_to_eks:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: aws configure
          uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
          with:
            aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
            aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
            aws-region: ap-south-1 
        - name: kubectl setup
          uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v4
          with:
            version: latest
        - name: kubectl configure
          run: aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ap-south-1 --name demo-eks-cluster
        - name: deploy to eks
          run: kubectl apply -f ./k8s_manifests/.
```

This job Deploys the application to the AWS EKS cluster.

**Checkout Code**

* For cloning the code into the runner, as the Kubernetes manifests files are located in the repository.
    

**AWS Configure**

* Configure your AWS access and secret keys into the runner for accessing the EKS cluster using the cli.
    
* uses the action ***aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials*** for configuring the aws.
    

**Kubectl Setup**

* Kubectl is the command-line tool for managing the Kubernetes. So we need to set up the kubectl in the GitHub Actions runner.
    
* uses the action ***azure/setup-kubectl*** for setting up the kubectl cli tool.
    

**Kubectl Configure**

* Runs the command *aws eks update-kubeconfig --region &lt;region\_name&gt;--name &lt;cluster\_name&gt;*
    
* This command is used for connecting to EKS cluster.
    

**Deploy the Application**

* Runs the command ***kubectl apply*** for deploying the application into the EKS cluster.
