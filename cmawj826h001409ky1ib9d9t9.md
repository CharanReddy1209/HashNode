## Introduction

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through building a **complete CI/CD pipeline** for a **Node.js application** using **GitHub Actions**. The pipeline covers:

* Security scanning with **Trivy** and **Gitleaks**
    
* Code quality analysis with **SonarQube**
    
* **Docker** image build and push to Docker Hub
    
* **Docker** image vulnerability scanning
    
* Deployment to **Kubernetes**
    

All of this is automated using **self-hosted GitHub Actions runners**, enabling full control over the environment and resources.

## Tools Used

| **TOOLS** | **PURPOSE** |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | Backend application |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD Workflow automation |
| SonarQube | Static code analysis and quality gate checks |
| Trivy | Security scanning for vulnerabilities |
| Gitleaks | Detects secrets like tokens or passwords in code |
| Docker | Containerizes the application |
| **Kubernetes** | Container orchestration |
| **Self-hosted GitHub Runner** | For running jobs inside the network |

## **What Does This CI/CD Pipeline Workflow Do?**

Here’s a high-level overview of the pipeline:

1. Performs security checks using Trivy and Gitleaks
    
2. SonarQube to analyse code quality
    
3. Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub
    
4. Deploys Application in to the Kubernetes cluster (in this project minikube)
    

> **Note:** This entire workflow runs on the self-hosted runner and I used Minikube for creating the Kubernetes single node cluster.

## Workflow Breakdown

Here’s a breakdown of each job defined in the CI/CD workflow :

### Step 1: Security Scan

```yaml
jobs:
  Security_scan:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Trivy filesystem Scan
        run: trivy fs --format table .

      - name: Gitleaks Scan
        run: gitleaks detect source . -f json
```

This Job scans the file system and gives the information about known vulnerabilities and the secrets if any present in the project.

**Checkout Code**

* For cloning the code into the GitHub Action runner machine. By using the actions/checkout action for the cloning the code.
    

**Trivy Scan**

* Trivy scan is used for the scanning the file system to find the known vulnerabilities in the project.
    

**Gitleaks Scan**

* Gitleaks is used to scan the code to check any accidentally committed secrets (like API keys or passwords).
    

### Step 2: **SonarQube Code Quality Analysis**

```yaml
  Sonar_scan:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: Security_scan
    steps:
      - name: SonarQube Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v5.1.0
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ vars.SONAR_HOST_URL }}

      - name: SonarQube Quality Gate Check
        uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-quality-gate-action@v1
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ vars.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
```

This job scans the code and provides a report on code quality.

**SonarQube Scan**

* It performs a static code analysis of your project to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, security issues, and code coverage.
    
* Generates a detailed report with metrics (e.g., technical debt, duplication, complexity).
    

**SonarQube Quality Gate Check**

* Defines a set of **pass/fail criteria** that a project must meet to be considered "production-ready."
    
* Determines if the code meets the required quality standards.
    
* Fails the build(in CI/CD) if conditions are not met.
    

> *Note: Store your* ***SONAR\_TOKEN*** *(secret) and* ***SONAR\_HOST\_URL*** *(variable) securely in your GitHub repository settings under Secrets and Variables.*

### Step 3: Docker Image Build and Push

```yaml
Image_build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: Sonar_scan
    env:
          IMAGE_NAME: node-app
          IMAGE_TAG: latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Docker Login
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Docker Setup Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - name: Image Build and Push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
      - name: Trivy image scan
        run: trivy image ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
```

This job is to build and push the Docker image, and scan the Docker image using the Trivy image scan.

**Docker Login**

* Using the action ***docker/login-action*** for login into Docker Hub or other image registry.
    

**Buildx**

* Buildx is used for building the Docker image
    

**Image Build and Push**

* This step is for building and pushing the docker image into the docker hub registry.
    

**Trivy Image Scan**

* This step is used to scan the Docker image using the Trivy Image scan to find the vulnerabilities.
    

> Note: Store your **DOCKER\_USERNAME** (variable) and **DOCKER\_PASSWORD** (secret) securely in your GitHub repository settings under Secrets and Variables.

### Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
  K8s_Deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    needs: Image_build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to k8s
        run: kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/.
```

This job is to apply Kubernetes manifest to deploy in to the cluster.

**Deploy to k8s**

* Runs the command ***kubectl apply*** for deploying the application into the cluster
    

## Conclusion

From running security scans with Trivy and Gitleaks to ensuring code quality with SonarQube, containerizing the application with Docker, and deploying it to Kubernetes, all the essential DevOps stages were covered.
