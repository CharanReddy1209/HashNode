In this blog post, we are going to build the Java application using the Maven build tool, by using Docker we will dockerize application, and deploy the application using Kubernetes.  
In this blog post, I will walk you through how I set up my project, and how I build and deployed it.

Clone this git repository for the project source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharanReddy129/Java_maven_Project.git
```

### STEP 1 : Using the maven build the artifact

```bash
mvn clean install
```

By using this command maven will compile the project source code, it will execute the unit test if there are any, and it will create a war file.

### STEP 2 : Building the docker image

After creating the artifact, now we need to build the docker image for this application. For creating the docker image we need to create the Dockerfile. This file contains the instruction on how to build the docker image.

```bash
docker build -t <docker_hub_user_name>/<image_name> . 
```

In this command

\-t — this option is used to tag the image with a custom name

&lt;docker\_hub\_user\_name&gt; — replace this with the username of your Docker Hub

&lt;image\_name&gt; — replace this with the custom name of the image

. — dot represent that Dockerfile is present at this current location

Now push this docker image to the Docker Hub registry. This will helpful while deploying the application into Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
docker push <docker_hub_user_name>/<image_name> 
```

### STEP 3 : Deploying the application using Kubernetes

Now you can deploy the application in Kubernetes. For this you need to create the deployment and service manifest file. You can get these two files from the k8s\_manifest folder in git repository.

After creating these two files we can deploy the application.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml  # deployment.yml and service.yml are the file name of he manifest
kubectl apply -f service.yml
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we successfully built a Java application using Maven, containerized it using Docker, and deployed it onto a Kubernetes cluster.

By mastering these basic steps, you’re building a strong foundation for modern DevOps practices.

Stay tuned for more posts where we will dive deeper into scaling applications, using CI/CD pipelines, and managing deployments in production environments!
